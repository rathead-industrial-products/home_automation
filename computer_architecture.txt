Application

=======================================================================
All devices run a server listening for connection requests on port 6445
Not all devices respond to all message types

magicmirror also runs an http server on port 6446 that proxies http requests
from the javascript app. It also logs health status messages and weather
from the Davis weatherlink and the ecobee thermostat
